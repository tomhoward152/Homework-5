# Homework-5

## Description
This is a simple way to schedule your work-day. Each hour is completely customizable and your notes are saved until you overwrite them. As each hour passes, the color coded time blocks are automatically updated as well.

## Takeaways
This project was made sense, and really brought a lot of concepts together for me. The one thing I struggled with was making my code as dry as possible. I got it complete and working as is but never could get it to work using functions. It is something I am working to improve though.
